### A Small Scale Reflection Extension for the Coq system

This is the user manual of SSReflect, a set of extensions to the proof
scripting language of the Coq proof assistant. While these extensions were
developed to support a particular proof methodology - small-scale reflection -
most of them actually are of a quite general nature, improving the
functionality of Coq in basic areas such as script layout and structuring,
proof context management, and rewriting. Consequently, and in spite of the
title of this document, most of the extensions described here should be of
interest for all Coq users, whether they embrace small-scale reflection or
not.
