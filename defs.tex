\section{Definitions}

\subsection{Definitions}\label{ssec:pose}

The standard \L+pose+ tactic allows to add a defined constant to a
proof context. \ssr{} generalises this tactic in several ways.
In particular, the \ssr{} \L+pose+ tactic supports \emph{open syntax}:
the body of
the definition does not need surrounding parentheses. For instance:
\begin{lstlisting}
  pose t := x + y.
\end{lstlisting}
is a valid tactic expression.

The standard \C{pose} tactic is also improved for the
local definition of higher order terms.
Local definitions of functions can use the same syntax as
global ones. The tactic:
\begin{lstlisting}
  pose f x y := x + y.
\end{lstlisting}
adds to the context the defined constant:
\begin{lstlisting}
  f := fun x y : nat => x + y : nat -> nat -> nat
\end{lstlisting}

The \ssr{} \C{pose} tactic also supports (co)fixpoints,
by providing the local counterpart of the 
\C{Fixpoint f := ... } and \C{CoFixpoint f := ... } constructs.
For instance, the following tactic:
\begin{lstlisting}
  pose fix f (x y : nat) {struct x} : nat := 
      if x is S p then S (f p y) else 0.
\end{lstlisting}
defines a local fixpoint \C{f}, which mimics the standard \C{plus}
operation on natural numbers.

Similarly, local cofixpoints can be defined by a tactic of the form:
\begin{lstlisting}
  pose cofix f (arg : T) ...
\end{lstlisting}

The possibility to include wildcards in the body of the definitions
 offers a smooth
way of defining local abstractions. The type of ``holes'' is
guessed by type inference, and the holes are abstracted.
For instance the tactic:
\begin{lstlisting}
  pose f := _ + 1.
\end{lstlisting}
is shorthand for:
\begin{lstlisting}
  pose f n := n + 1.
\end{lstlisting}

When the local definition of a function involves both arguments and
holes, hole abstractions appear first. For instance, the
tactic:
\begin{lstlisting}
  pose f x := x + _.
\end{lstlisting}
is shorthand for:
\begin{lstlisting}
  pose f n x := x + n.
\end{lstlisting}


The interaction of the \C{pose} tactic with the interpretation of
implicit arguments results in a powerful and concise syntax for local
definitions involving dependant types.
For instance, the tactic:
\begin{lstlisting}
  pose f x y := (x, y).
\end{lstlisting}
adds to the context the local definition:
\begin{lstlisting}
  pose f (Tx Ty : Type) (x : Tx) (y : Ty) := (x, y).
\end{lstlisting}
The generalisation of wildcards makes the use of the \L+pose+ tactic
ressemble ML-like definitions of polymorphic functions.

% The use of \C{Prenex Implicits} declarations (see section
% \ref{ssec:parampoly}), makes this feature specially convenient.
% Note that this combines with the interpretation of wildcards, and that
% it is possible to define:
% \begin{lstlisting}
%   pose g x y : prod _ nat := (x, y).
% \end{lstlisting}
% which is equivalent to:
% \begin{lstlisting}
%   pose g x (y : nat) := (x, y).
% \end{lstlisting}



\subsection{Abbreviations}\label{ssec:set}


The \ssr{} \L+set+ tactic performs abbreviations: it introduces a
defined constant for a subterm appearing in the goal and/or in the
context.

\ssr{} extends the standard \Coq{} \C{set} tactic by supplying:
\begin{itemize}
\item an open syntax, similarly to the \L+pose+ tactic;
\item a more aggressive matching algorithm;
% (which may cause some
%  script incompatibilities with standard \Coq{});
\item an improved interpretation of wildcards, taking advantage of the
  matching algorithm;
\item an improved occurrence selection mechanism allowing to abstract only
  selected occurrences of a term.
\end{itemize}

The general syntax of this tactic is
\[\C{set}\ \N{ident}\ [\C{:}\ \N{term}_1]\ \C{:=}\ [\N{occ-switch}]\;\N{term}_2\]

\[\N{occ-switch}\ \equiv\ \C{\{}[\C{+}|\C{-}]\;\N{num}^*\C{\}}\]


where:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\N{ident}$ is a fresh identifier chosen by the user.
\item $\N{term}_1$ is 
an optional type annotation. The type annotation $\N{term}_1$ can be
given in open syntax (no surrounding parentheses). If no $\N{occ-switch}$ 
(described hereafter) is present, it is also
the case for $\N{term}_2$.
On the other hand, in  presence of $\N{occ-switch}$, parentheses
surrounding $\N{term}_2$ are mandatory.
\item In the occurrence switch $\N{occ-switch}$, if the first element
  of the list is a $\N{num}$, this element should be a number, and not
  an $\mathcal{L}$-tac variable. The empty list \L+{}+ is not interpreted as a
  valid occurrence switch.
\end{itemize}
% For example, the script:
% \begin{lstlisting}
%   Goal forall (f : nat -> nat)(x y : nat), f x + f x = f x.
%   move=> f x y.
% \end{lstlisting}

The tactic:
\begin{lstlisting}
  set t := f _.
\end{lstlisting}
transforms the goal \C{ f x + f x = f x} into \C{t + t = t}, adding
\C{t := f x} to the context, and the tactic:
\begin{lstlisting}
  set t := {2}(f _).
\end{lstlisting}
transforms it into \C{f x + t = f x}, adding \C{t := f x} to the context.

The type annotation $\N{term}_1$ may
contain wildcards, which will be filled with the appropriate value by
the matching process.

The tactic first tries to find a subterm of the goal matching
$\N{term}_2$ (and its type $\N{term}_1$),
and stops at the first subterm it finds. Then the occurrences
of this subterm selected by the optional $\N{occ-switch}$ are replaced
by $\N{ident}$ and a definition \C{$\N{ident}$ := $\N{term}$} is added to
the context. If no $\N{occ-switch}$ is present, then all the
occurrences are abstracted.

\subsubsection*{Matching}

The matching algorithm compares a pattern \textit{term}
 with a subterm of the goal by comparing their heads
and then pairwise unifying their arguments (modulo conversion). Head
symbols match under the following conditions:

\begin{itemize}
\item If the head of \textit{term} is a constant, then it
  should be syntactically equal to the head symbol of the subterm.
\item If this head is a projection of a canonical structure,
  then canonical structure equations are used for the matching.
\item If the head of \textit{term} is \emph{not} a constant, the
  subterm should have the same structure ($\lambda$ abstraction,
  \L+let$\dots$in+ structure ...).
\item If the head of \textit{term} is a hole, the subterm should have
  at least as many arguments as  \textit{term}. For instance the tactic:
\begin{lstlisting}
  set t := _ x.
\end{lstlisting}
transforms the goal \L-x + y = z- into \L+t y = z+ and adds
\L+t := plus x : nat -> nat+ to the context.

\item In the special case where \textit{term} is of the form 
\L+(let f := $t_0$ in f) $t_1\dots t_n$+,
 then the pattern \textit{term} is treated
as \L+(_ $t_1\dots t_n$)+. For each subterm in
the goal having the form $(A\  u_1\dots u_{n'})$ with $n' \geq n$, the
matching algorithm successively tries to find the largest
partial application $(A\ u_1\dots u_{i'})$ convertible to the head 
$t_0$ of \textit{term}. For instance the following tactic:
\begin{lstlisting}
  set t := (let g y z := y.+1 + z in g) 2.
\end{lstlisting}
transforms the goal
\begin{lstlisting}  
  (let f x y z := x + y + z in f 1) 2 3 = 6.
\end{lstlisting}
into \C{t 3 = 6} and adds the local definition of \C{t} to the
context.
\end{itemize}

Moreover:
\begin{itemize}
\item Multiple holes in \textit{term} are treated as independent
  placeholders. For instance, the tactic:
\begin{lstlisting}
  set t := _ + _.
\end{lstlisting}
transforms the goal \C{x + y = z} into \C{t = z} and pushes 
\C{t := x + y : nat} in the context.
\item The type of the subterm matched should fit the type
  (possibly casted by some type annotations) of the pattern
  \textit{term}.
\item The replacement of the subterm found by the instanciated pattern
  should not capture variables, hence the following script:
\begin{lstlisting}
  Goal forall x : nat, x + 1 = 0.
  set u := _ + 1.
\end{lstlisting}
raises an error message, since \L+x+ is bound in the goal.
\item Typeclass inference should fill in any residual hole, but
matching should never assign a value to a global existential variable.

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Occurrence selection}\label{sssec:occselect}

\ssr{} provides a generic syntax for the selection of occurrences by
their position indexes. These \emph{occurrence switches} are shared by
all
\ssr{} tactics which require control on subterm selection like rewriting,
generalisation, ... 

An \emph{occurrence switch} can be:
\begin{itemize}
\item A list \C{ \{+$\N{num}^*$ \} } of occurrences affected by the
  tactic. 
For instance, the tactic:
\begin{lstlisting}
  set x := {1 3}(f 2).
\end{lstlisting}
transforms the goal \C{f 2 + f 8 = f 2 + f 2} into
\C{x + f 8 = f 2  + x}, and adds the abbreviation
\L+x := f 2+ in the
context. Notice that, like in standard \Coq{},
 some occurrences of a
given term may be hidden to the user, for example because of a
notation. The vernacular \C{$\texttt{\textcolor{dkviolet}{Set }}$
  Printing All} command displays all
these hidden occurrences and should be used to find the correct
coding of the occurrences to be selected\footnote{Unfortunately,
even after a call to the Set Printing All command, some occurrences are
still not displayed to the user, essentially the ones possibly hidden
in the predicate of a dependent match structure.}. For instance, both
in \ssr{} and in standard \Coq{}, the following script:
\begin{lstlisting}
  Notation "a < b":= (le (S a) b).
  Goal forall x y, x < y -> S x < S y.
  intros x y; set t := S x.
\end{lstlisting}
generates the goal
\L+t <= y -> t < S y+ since \L+x < y+ is now a notation for 
\L+S x <= y+.
\item A list \L-{$\N{num}^+$}-. This is equivalent to
    \L-{+$\N{num}^+$}- but the list should start with a number, and
  not with an $\mathcal{L}$-tac variable.
\item A list \L+{-$\N{num}^*$}+ of occurrences \emph{not} to be
  affected by the tactic. For instance, the tactic:
\begin{lstlisting}
  set x := {-2}(f 2).
\end{lstlisting}
behaves like
\begin{lstlisting}
  set x := {1 3}(f 2).
\end{lstlisting}
on the goal \L-f 2 + f 8 = f 2 + f 2- which has three occurrences of
the the term \L+f 2+
\item In particular, the switch \L-{+}- selects \emph{all} the
  occurrences. This switch is useful to turn
  off the default behaviour of a tactic which automatically clears 
  some assumptions (see section \ref{ssec:discharge} for instance).
\item The switch \L+{-}+ imposes that \emph{no} occurrences of the
  term should be affected by the tactic. The tactic:
\begin{lstlisting}
  set x := {-}(f 2).
\end{lstlisting}
leaves the goal unchanged and adds the definition \L+x := f 2+ to the
context. This kind of tactic may be used to take advantage of the
power of the matching algorithm in a local definition, instead of
copying large terms by hand.
\end{itemize}


It is important to remember that matching \emph{precedes} occurrence
selection, hence the tactic:
\begin{lstlisting}
  set a := {2}(_ + _).
\end{lstlisting}
transforms the goal \C{x + y = x + y + z} into \C{x + y = a + z}
and fails on the goal \\
\C{(x + y) + (z + z) = z + z} with the error message:
\begin{lstlisting}
  User error: only 1 < 2 occurrence of (x + y + (z + z))
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Localisation}\label{ssec:loc}


It is possible to define an abbreviation for a term appearing in the
context of a goal thanks to the \L+in+ tactical.

A tactic of the form:
\begin{lstlisting}
  set x := /*term*/ in /*fact$_1$*/ $\dots$/*fact$_n$*/.
\end{lstlisting}
introduces a defined constant called \L+x+ in the context, and folds
it in the facts \textit{fact$_1 \dots$ fact$_n$}
The body of \L+x+ is the first subterm matching \textit{term} in 
\textit{fact$_1 \dots$ fact$_n$}.

A tactic of the form:
\begin{lstlisting}
  set x := /*term*/ in /*fact$_1$*/ $\dots$/*fact$_n$*/ *.
\end{lstlisting}
matches $\N{term}$ and then folds \L+x+ similarly in
\textit{fact$_1 \dots$ fact$_n$}, but also folds \L+x+ in the goal.

A goal \L-x + t = 4-, whose context contains \L+Hx : x = 3+, is left
unchanged by the tactic:
\begin{lstlisting}
  set z := 3 in Hx.
\end{lstlisting}
but the context is extended with the definition \L+z := 3+ and \L+Hx+ becomes
\L+Hx : x = z+.
On the same goal and context, the tactic:
\begin{lstlisting}
  set z := 3 in Hx *.
\end{lstlisting}
will moreover change the goal into \L-x + t = S z-. Indeed, remember
that \C{4} is just a notation for \C{(S 3)}.

The use of the \L+in+ tactical is not limited to the localisation of
abbreviations: for a complete description of the \L+in+ tactical, see
section \ref{ssec:profstack}.



% The restriction on the tactics that can be put on the left side of a
% \C{in} tactical is motivated by the risk of clash with the standard $\mathcal{L}$-tac
% \C{in}. Nevertheless, prefixing the tactic by the \C{do} tactical
% makes any localisation  possible. This combination \C{do ... in} is
% described in section \ref{ssec:iter}.

% If the tactic passed to the \C{in} tactical creates knew
% facts and/or performs introduction or discharge operations, the
% tactic will still succeed if the reintroduction step of the \C{in}
% internal behaviour is possible. For instance the following script is
% valid:
% \begin{lstlisting}
%   Inductive test : Prop := T1 : nat -> nat -> test.

%   Goal forall t1 t2: test, t1 = t2 -> True.
%   move=> t1 t2 H.
%   move: t1 => [x1 x2] /= in H.
% \end{lstlisting}
% and it changes the introduced hypothesis \C{H : t1 = t2} into 
% \C{T1 x1 x2 = t2}, while adding \C{x1 x2 : nat} in the context of the
% proof.

%  If an abbreviation is present in the list of facts on the right side
%  of a \C{in} tactical and if the tactic of the left side performs $\zeta$
%  reduction (like the standard \C{simpl} does), then the tactic may
%  fail. Indeed,
%  the abbreviation is generalised and vanishes after the reduction,
%  hence it cannot be re-introduced.

% In fact tactics of the form \C{simpl in ...} should be replaced by 
% \C{rewrite /= in ...}(see section \ref{sec:rw}). This last tactic
% prevents the untimely reduction
% of $\zeta$ redexes created by the generalisation phase of tactical \C{in}.
